## Background

Have you ever noticed how much time you spend waiting in line at a theme park? While I am a Cloud Engineer by day, I am a roller coaster enthusiast on nights and weekends. In a typical calendar year, I will visit 15-20 different amusement parks for a grand total of 40-50 visits. So I've certainly noticed, to say the least.

Suppose you visit a park from 11am opening to 8pm closing. In those 9 hours, it is entirely typical to wait 30 minutes for each ride, on average. Even after removing time for meals, walking, and actually riding the rides, you will still spend upwards of 4 hours just waiting in line. On a *good* day. Skip-the-line passes are incredibly expensive: $250 on the busiest days at Cedar Point in 2021. So this begs the question: what if you didn't have to wait in long lines OR spend money on ride passes?

Enter [Queue-Times](https://queue-times.com/). Queue-Times not only uses historical data to predict crowd volumes at 100+ amusement parks - they also provide real-time wait times for each park, updated every 5 minutes.

Many parks now offer iPhone/Android apps with maps, wait times, and more. However, each app offers a variety features and functions (and varying degrees of usability). So, let's kill two birds with one stone:
1. Rather than downloading an app for each park, build **one application for all parks** leveraging Queue-Times.
2. Rather than having to check the app for wait times, build a notification system that **tells me when the line is short**.

And thus the `queue-times-app` was born.
